The internet was always meant to connect people; the entire purpose of
connecting computers through standard protocols was to create something greater
than the sum of its parts, to allow its human authors to contribute, share, and
benefit from one another's work.

The Rebel Web believes fundamentally in the social nature of the web, and not in
the weird, robotic, world-dominating way that Mark Zuckerberg describes it. Long
before Facebook existed, the web connected people with common interests.
